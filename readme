<!-- pain points 
<Pain Point 1

Students know they need to study but don’t know how to break big goals into small daily tasks, so they feel confused and overwhelmed.

Pain Point  2

Students struggle to plan their study time. They have exams or deadlines coming up but can’t organize topics across their available hours.

Pain Point  3

Students often make vague plans like “study more,” but they don’t know when to study which topic, which leads to last-minute cramming.

Pain Point  4

Students have limited time and many topics, but no clear structure. They find it difficult to balance workloads or include revision for harder subjects.

Pain Point  5

Without a guided plan, students feel stressed and unsure how to prepare effectively for an upcoming exam or project.

F. UI_Sketch_Vision.

UI Vision 

The UI is designed to be clear and easy to follow. Each major step (goal, topics, availability, schedule) is placed in its own page to avoid confusion. Students only see the information they need at each step.
The final schedule is shown in clean day-wise cards, making it easy for students to know what to study each day. The goal is to reduce stress by keeping everything simple, organized, and easy to understand.
